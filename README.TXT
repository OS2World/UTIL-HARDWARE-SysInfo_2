Hi ,

Welcome to Sysinfo. There was a number of reasons that I wrote Sysinfo.
First, just to use the System call; Second, for my own collection of 
utilities; Finally to spend time with the Notebook Control.

I have included the source with this EXE to let you see how I got the 
system settings. If you notice how I use the Notebook Control; you 
will see a very simple call to Create it, Add pages to it and Close
it. These routines are found in the NOTEBOOK.LIB. I wrote them and
have included the LIB & H for your use if you want to use them. 

If you are interested in the API's that I created for the Notebook
Control, they are available. I am still in the process of writing
up the Technical reference guide for them. If you are interested
in the full documentation on these API's they are available for
a ONE TIME registration fee of $50.00 US dollars. This documentation 
will highlight all the API's I wrote to make the Notebook Control
easier to communicate with.

If you are interested in the actual API source in addition to the 
documentation; they are both available as one package for a ONE TIME 
registration fee of $150.00 US dollars.

Please note the ONE TIME registration fee. What this means; you will 
automatically receive any updates, enhancements or bug fixes FREE
with every upgrade I release with respect to this Library !

If you just want to use the NOTEBOOK Library in you own programs,
you may do so FREE of charge. You can use the Sysinfo as an example 
on how to do so.

I would like to thank you for taking the time to download my utility !
